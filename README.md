AzOpenAI is a Golang SDK for interfacing with an Azure hosted OpenAI cluster. It provides a simple and easy-to-use interface for requesting various types of responses from OpenAI, such as text generation, question answering, and more.

## Installation

To use AzOpenAI in your Go project, you can simply add the following import statement:go
```go
import "github.com/element-of-surprise/azopenai"
```

Then, run ```go get``` to download and install the package:bash
```bash
go get github.com/element-of-surprise/azopenai
```Usage
```

## Usage

Here is an example of how to use AzOpenAI to generate text using the OpenAI completions API endpoint:go
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"

	"github.com/element-of-surprise/azopenai"
)

func main() {
	client, err := azopenai.New("resourceName", "deplomentID", auth.Authorizer{ApiKey: "yourAPIKey"})
    if err != nil {
        // handle err
    }

    completions := client.Completions()

    resp, err := completions.Call([]string{"The capital of California is"})
	if err != nil {
		// handle error
	}
	fmt.Println(resp.Completions[0].Text)
}
```

In this example, ```azopenai.New()``` is used to create a new AzOpenAI client with your OpenAI API key. 

Then the returned client aggregator `client` has `client.Completions()` called to get a client for the completions endpoint.

Next, ```completions.Call()``` is invoked on the client with the prompt(s) and any additional options specified. 

Finally, the text generated by the OpenAI API is printed to the console.
